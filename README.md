    DevQuest Projects

## PokeDex
    A digital encyclopedia featuring details about Pokémon that may be found in the wilderness.
    It includes a day/night cycle to display Pokémon based on your local timezone, so if you visit the page at night,
    it will only show Pokémons that can be found during the night and vice versa, but you can also change day/night using a
    button on the top-right corner.
    
    To Do: 
    * Change layout to pkedex starting as closed.
    * Use opening interaction to start and closing to stop music.
    * Fix scrolling on cellphone being too slow.
    * Fix main div getting the wrong height when first opened.
    * Fix main div not having a scroll bar when needed. OBS: Maybe it has something to do with the wrong height problem.
    * Pick better colors.
    * Change pokeball sprite to a pokedex and add open/close animation.
    * Add images for night/day background.
    * Add Pokemon OST "Mt. Moon cave" for night hours and "Pikachu's beach" for the day.

## X-Men
    A X-Men themed character selection screen.

    To Do:

    * Think in a way to start/stop music.
    * Fix background responsiveness.
    * Add X-Men theme song.
