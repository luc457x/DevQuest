## PokeDex
    A digital encyclopedia featuring details about Pokémon that may be found in the wilderness. It includes a day/night cycle to display Pokémon based on your local timezone, so if you visit the page at night, it will only show Pokémons that can be found during the night and vice versa, but you can also change day/night using a button on the top-right corner.
    
    To Do: 
    * Pick better colors.
    * Change pokeball sprite to a pokedex opening.
    * Add images for night/day background.
