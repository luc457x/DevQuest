## PokeDex
    A digital encyclopedia featuring details about Pokémon that may be found in the wilderness.
    It includes a day/night cycle to display Pokémon based on your local timezone, so if you visit the page at night,
    it will only show Pokémons that can be found during the night and vice versa, but you can also change day/night using a
    button on the top-right corner.
    
    To Do: 
    * Fix main div getting the wrong height when first opened.
    * Fix main div not having a scroll bar when needed. OBS: Maybe it has something to do with the wrong height problem.
    * Pick better colors.
    * Change pokeball sprite to a pokedex and add open/close animation.
    * Add images for night/day background.

## X-Men characters
    A X-Men themed character selection screen.

    To Do:
    * Fix background responsiveness.
